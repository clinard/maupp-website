The MAUPP project (**M**odelling and forecasting **A**frican **U**rban **P**opulation **P**atterns for vulnerability and health assessments) is a four-year research project funded by the STEREO-III program of the Belgian Science Policy (BELSPO).

The main objective of MAUPP is to develop models and forecasts to improve our knowledge of sub-Saharan African urban population patterns for a wider usage of urban population distribution datasets in vulnerability and health assessments. The MAUPP project aims to contribute to the [WorldPop](http://www.worldpop.org) open access archive of spatial demographic datasets.
