Catherine participated to the [Global Land Project third Open Science Meeting](http://www.glp-osm2016.com/) (GLP-OSM) in Beijing, China, October 24-27, 2016. She organized a session with two WorldPop colleagues on 'Global High Resolution Population Denominators and Urban Spatial Dynamics'. The session was very well attended and included seven different talks that ranged from the methodological aspects of global population datasets to the quantification and implications of remote-sensing derived measures of land cover, specifically urban systems. Catherine presented the MAUPP project in her presentation entitled 'Modelling and forecasting urban expansion in Africa'.
